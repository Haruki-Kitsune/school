        <h5>Japanese console role-playing games</h5>
        <h6>
          The earliest role-playing video game on a console was Dragonstomper on the Atari 2600 in 1982.
          Bokosuka Wars, originally released for the Sharp X1 computer in 1983, was ported to the NES console in 1985,
          and was a commercial success in Japan, where it laid the foundations for the tactical role-playing game
          subgenre.
          Other notable early console RPGs included ports of Namco's 1984 arcade action role-playing games: The Tower of
          Druaga, which was ported to the NES in 1985, and Dragon Buster, the first video game to feature a life meter
          (called "Vitality" in-game), also ported to the NES in 1987.

        <h5>Japanese computer role-playing games</h5>
        <h6>
          While the Japanese video game industry has long been viewed as console-centric in the Western world, due to
          the worldwide success of Japanese consoles beginning with the NES, the country had in fact produced thousands
          of commercial personal computer games from the late 1970s up until the mid-1990s, in addition to d≈çjin soft
          independent games.
          The country's computer market was very fragmented at first; Lode Runner, for example, reportedly required 34
          conversions to different hardware platforms.
          The market eventually became dominated by the NEC PC-8801 and PC-9801, though with some competition from the
          Sharp X1 and X68000; FM-7 and FM Towns; and MSX and MSX2.
          A key difference between Western and Japanese systems at the time was the latter's higher display resolutions
          (640x400) in order to accommodate Japanese text which in turn influenced game design.</h6>
        <h5>South Korean role-playing games</h5>
        <h6>
          South Korea's RPG industry began with translations of RPGs imported from Japan and the United States.
          The first fully translated Japanese RPG in Korea was Phantasy Star (1987) for the Sega Master System, which
          was licensed by Samsung and released as the Samsung Gam*Boy in South Korea, on April 1989. The country's first
          fully-fledged computer RPG was Sin'geom-ui Jeonseol, also known as Legend of the Sword, released for the Apple
          II computer platform in 1987.
          It was programmed by Nam In-Hwan and distributed by Aproman, and was primarily influenced by the Ultima
          series.
          In the late 1980s, the Korean company Topia began producing action role-playing games, one of which was
          Pungnyu Hyeopgaek for the MS-DOS in 1989. It was the first Korean title published for IBM PC compatibles and
          is set in ancient China. Another action RPG released by Topia that same year was Mirae Sonyeon Conan, a video
          game adaptation of Hayao Miyazaki's Japanese 1978 anime series Future Boy Conan, for the MSX2 platform.

        <h5>Chinese role-playing games</h5>
        <h6>
          Heroes of Jin Yong (1996), a Taiwanese tactical role-playing game based on the popular historical novels by
          Jin Yong, featured a number of melee and ranged kung fu skills to train and develop, as well as a grid-based
          movement system.
          China has a number of domestically produced games.
          These include Westward Journey, Perfect World, and The Incorruptible Warrior.
          There are a large number of domestically-produced MMORPGs in China, although many generally remain unheard of
          outside the country.
